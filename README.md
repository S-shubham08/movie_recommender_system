## Project Description
This project implements a movie recommender system using the TMDB (The Movie Database) dataset. The recommender system suggests movies to users based on their preferences and provides the ability to search for movies and get recommendations.

  You can download the TMDB dataset from
  - Dataset Source - (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata?select=tmdb_5000_movies.csv)

## Project Strcuture
- /models: Stores the trained recommendation models.
- app.py: Includes the Streamlit web application and API.
- requirements.txt: List of dependencies required to run the project.

## Install the required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Model Training
- The recommender system models are trained using the data in the Jupyter Notebook present in a directory.
- The trained models are saved in /models directory.

## Usage
- Load the trained recommendation model and the TMDB dataset.
- Use the model to generate recommendations based on user preferences.

## Streamlit App
- Create a Streamlit web application to interact with the movie recommender system.
- Build an interface where users can search for movies and get recommendations.
